# Numerical-Methods-In-Physics-Cpp

A Repository hosting the C++ implementation[code] of common numerical procedures encountered in Computational Physics. 
A background in introductory Numerical Methods course is assumed, and the code in the C++ language is provided.
The required text was that by Burden&Faires-9th edition.

\\code is uploaded as they become available.
Algorithms covered:
[Root Finding]: 1. Bisection 2. Newton-Raphson 3. Secant Method.
